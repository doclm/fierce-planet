== Welcome to FiercePlanet

FiercePlanet is a game for learning about sustainability. It is modelled on
common tower defence games, with the difference that the goal here is to save
citizens rather than destroy enemies.

FiercePlanet is built upon Ruby on Rails and uses JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3
extensively for scripting animation and user interaction. It also uses a
simple agent-based framework for modelling the individual decisions agents make
as they wander through the environment. It aims to provide a very rudimentary
"social simulation".
